## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with:
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gitflow
- JavaScript 

### Continued development

I still feel like much of my code could be more DRY. In the future, I wish to improve the reusability of many functions


### Useful resources
